AI Agent Project
An intelligent agent designed to process structured data from CSV files or Google Sheets, perform web searches based on user-defined queries, extract information using a language model (LLM), and present the results in an intuitive dashboard.

üìú Project Overview
This AI agent leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to streamline data analysis and information retrieval. It automates:

Data ingestion from CSV files or Google Sheets.
Web searches based on user-defined queries.
Information extraction from specific data columns using an LLM.
Dashboard presentation for seamless user interaction.
The project is ideal for handling large datasets and performing research tasks with precision and speed.
