AI Agent Project
An intelligent agent designed to process structured data from CSV files or Google Sheets, perform web searches based on user-defined queries, extract information using a language model (LLM), and present the results in an intuitive dashboard.

üìú Project Overview
This AI agent leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to streamline data analysis and information retrieval. It automates the following tasks:

Data ingestion: Supports CSV files and Google Sheets as input.
Web searches: Executes searches based on user-defined queries.
Information extraction: Utilizes LLMs to extract relevant data from specified columns.
Dashboard presentation: Displays results and insights in an interactive and user-friendly interface.
This project is designed for handling large datasets and research tasks with precision and efficiency.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

1.Python: Version 3.8 or later.
2.pip: For managing Python packages.
3.Streamlit: For creating the dashboard interface.

You will also need API keys for:
1.SERPAPI: For web search functionality.
2.Hugging Face: For LLM-based processing.
3.Google Cloud: For accessing Google Sheets.

Clone the Repository
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Shagunjha0111/ai-agent-project.git
cd ai-agent-project


Install Dependencies
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:
Copy code
SERPAPI_API_KEY=your_serpapi_key
GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=path_to_google_credentials.json
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_key
